# Namesong

There's an idea in music to convert text (usually names obviously) into melodies. I think of this from time to time but
never try out melodies generated this way because it's a bummer. I'm hoping to make it a little less of a bummer here.

### Some ideas for use:

1. As a real melody, duh.
2. Goal notes (fill in and make it sound good)
